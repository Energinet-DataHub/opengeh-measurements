  Summertime change + period edge tests

cases_tested:
  "Missing Measurements Log Tests":
    - "GIVEN an MP with 15M resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for a quarter THEN the day with the missing quarter should be in the result"
    - "GIVEN an MP with 1H resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for an hour THEN the day with the missing hour should be in the result"

  "Period Edge Tests":
    - "First hour of calculation period missing"
    - "Last hour of calculation period missing"
    - "First quarter of calculation period missing"
    - "Last quarter of calculation period missing"

  "Summer/Wintertime handling":
    "Calculation period covers wintertime change"

  "Grid Area Logic":
    - "GIVEN NO grid area job parameters are included THEN missing measurements from all MPs should be in the result"
