  Gap scenario. The scenario includes both a 15M resolution and a 1H resolution MP with the characteristics below:

                    |Feb. 25th          Feb. 26th           Feb. 27th           Feb. 28th           Feb. 29th           March. 1st
                    |-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  MP period 1:      |---------------------------------------|
  MP period 2:                                                                                      |-------------------|

  Missing:                     |                 |                    |                  |                             |         |

  Missing days:     |Feb. 25th          |Feb. 26th                                                  |Feb. 29th

  We also check that only MPs in grid area supplied with job_parameters are included in result.

cases_tested:
  "Missing Measurements Log Tests":
    - "Metering Point with 15M resolution"
    - "Metering Point with 1H resolution"
    - "Calculation period covers MP which stops and/or starts"

  "Leap Year Tests":
    - "Time series has quarter missing on feb. 29th"
    - "Time series has hour missing on feb. 29th"

  "Grid Area Logic":
    - "Calculation covers a single Grid Area"
