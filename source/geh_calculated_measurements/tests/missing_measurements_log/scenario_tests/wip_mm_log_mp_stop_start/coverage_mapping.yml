  CASE 7 AND 8

  Gap scenario. The scenario includes both a 15M resolution and a 1H resolution MP with the characteristics below:

                        |Feb. 25th          Feb. 26th           Feb. 27th           Feb. 28th           Feb. 29th           March. 1st
                        |-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  MP 7 period 1         |---------------------------------------|
  MP 8 period 2                                                                                           |-------------------|
  Measurement data:     +++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++ +++++++++++
  Missing:                         |                 |                    |                  |                             |         |
  Missing days:         |Feb. 25th          |Feb. 26th                                                  |Feb. 29th

  CASE 11
  MP 11 Period 1 (1h):  |---------------------------------------|
  MP 12 Period 2 (15M):                                         |-------------------|
  Measurement data:                                             +++++ +++++++++++++++
  Missing:                                                           |
  Missing days:         |Feb. 25th          |Feb. 26th          |Feb. 27th

  CASE 9/10: We also check that only MPs in grid area supplied with job_parameters are included in result.

cases_tested:
  "Missing Measurements Log Tests":
    - "GIVEN an MP with 15M resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for a quarter THEN the day with the missing quarter should be in the result"
    - "GIVEN an MP with 1H resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for an hour THEN the day with the missing hour should be in the result"
    - "GIVEN an MP with 15M resolution WHEN there is a measurement for a quarter with quality 'missing' THEN the day with that measurement should be in the result"
    - "GIVEN an MP with 1H resolution WHEN there is measurement for an hour with quality 'missing' THEN the day with that measurement should be in the result"
    - "Calculation period covers MP which stops and/or starts"
    - "MP changes resolution"

  "Leap Year Tests":
    - "Time series has quarter missing on feb. 29th"
    - "Time series has hour missing on feb. 29th"

  "Grid Area Logic":
    - "GIVEN job parameters include MULTIPLE grid areas THEN only missing measurements from MPs in those grid areas should be in the result"
