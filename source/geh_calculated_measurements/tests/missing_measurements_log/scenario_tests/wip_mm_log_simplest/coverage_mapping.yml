  Simplest scenario

cases_tested:
  "Missing Measurements Log Tests":
    - "GIVEN an MP with 15M resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for a quarter THEN the day of the quarter should be in the result"
    - "GIVEN an MP with 1H resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for an hour THEN the day with the missing hour should be in the result"

  "Grid Area Logic":
    - "GIVEN job parameters include a SINGLE grid area THEN only missing measurements from MPs in that grid area should be in the result"
