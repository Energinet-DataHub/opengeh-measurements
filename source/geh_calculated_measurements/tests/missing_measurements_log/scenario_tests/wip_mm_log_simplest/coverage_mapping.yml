  Simplest scenario

                        | Jan. 15th  |       
  MP 201 (1h)           |---------------------------------------
  MP 202 (15M)          |---------------------------------------
  MP 000                |---------------------------------------
  Measurement data:     |+++++++++ ++| 
  Missing:                        |                 
  Missing days:         |  15th Jan. |

cases_tested:
  "Missing Measurements Log Tests":
    - "GIVEN an MP with 15M resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for a quarter THEN the day of the quarter should be in the result"
    - "GIVEN an MP with 1H resolution WHEN there is measurement missing for an hour THEN the day with the missing hour should be in the result"

  "Grid Area Logic":
    - "GIVEN job parameters include a SINGLE grid area THEN only missing measurements from MPs in that grid area should be in the result"
