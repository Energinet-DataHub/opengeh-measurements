"Electrical heating without net settlement group"

Base consumption metering point behaviour
"If (total period consumption < period limit) AND (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
"If (total period consumption < period limit) AND (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
"If (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
"If period = 1 year AND there is no net settlement group end of period THEN period limit = 4000"

Summer/winter time
"If it is the day of summer daylight savings change THEN we should only aggregate daily consumption for 23 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 21.45"
"If it is the day of winter daylight savings change THEN we should aggregate daily consumption for 25 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 22.45"
