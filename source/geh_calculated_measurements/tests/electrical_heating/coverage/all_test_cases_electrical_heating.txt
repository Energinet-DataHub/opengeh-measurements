Base consumption metering point behaviour
"GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
"GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
"WHEN (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
"GIVEN period = 1 year WHEN there is no end-of-period THEN base period limit = 4000"

Leap year
"GIVEN the period less than 1 year WHEN the period is a non-leap-year period THEN base period limit = (# period days/365 * 4000)"
"GIVEN the period less than 1 year WHEN the period is a leap-year period THEN base period limit = (# period days/366 * 4000)"

Summer/winter time
"If it is the day of summer daylight savings change THEN we should only aggregate daily consumption for 23 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 21.45"
"If it is the day of winter daylight savings change THEN we should aggregate daily consumption for 25 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 22.45"
