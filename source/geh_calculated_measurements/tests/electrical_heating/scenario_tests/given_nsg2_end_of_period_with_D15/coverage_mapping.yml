  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test variants of NSG2 (with net consumption) scenarios.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  CASE 2

  CASE 3 (summer/winter time)
                                     |March 30th (1 day before summertime)        | October 28th (1 day after wintertime)

  Measurement data:                  +++                                        +++

  CASE 4 (hit limit at winter time edge case)

  Days in period:                    | 213 days                                   |
  Measurement data:                   +                                          +



cases_tested:
  "Electrical Heating Tests":
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to electrical heating MP point for the day"
    - "WHEN (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"

  "Period length and base period limit":
    - "GIVEN (period length = 1 year) WHEN there is no end-of-period THEN base period limit = 4000"

  "Summer/Wintertime handling":
    - "GIVEN it is the day of summer daylight savings change THEN we should only aggregate daily consumption for 23 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 21.45"
    - "GIVEN it is the day of winter daylight savings change THEN we should aggregate daily consumption for 25 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 22.45"

  "Net Settlement Groups":
    - "Electrical heating with net settlement group 2 - WITH net consumption MP"

  "Settlement Group Calculation Type":
    - "END OF PERIOD calculation"
    - "UP TO END of period calculation"
