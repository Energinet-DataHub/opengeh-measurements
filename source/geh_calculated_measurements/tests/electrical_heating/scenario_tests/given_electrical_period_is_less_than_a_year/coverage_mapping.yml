  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test scenarios where limit is not 4000 due to period being less than a year.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

  CASE 1
                      ________|2024__________|2025___
  Consumption start/end:       |------------------...
  Measurement data:         +   +              +
  Periods:                |___|______________|____...

  CASE 2 - gap across two years
                      ________|2024__________________
  Consumption start/end:  |--------------|
  Measurement data:         +   +
  Periods:                |___|__________|

  CASE 3 - period of 1 day
                      ________|2024__________________
  Consumption start/end:         ||
  Measurement data:              +
  Periods:                       ||

  CASE 4
                      __|2024_______________
  Consumption start/end:       |---------...
  Measurement data:    +++++++++++++++++++++
  Periods:                     |____________

  CASE 5 - gap in same year
                      |2024        |2025
  Parent start/end:   |------|  |--------|
  Child 1 start/end:  |------|
  Child 2 start/end:            |--------|
  Measurement data:     +  +  +  +  +  +  +
  Added to child:       *  *     *  *  *

  CASE 6 - non-matching parent/child periods
  This is really an invalid state, but it can happen i production, so we include a test for it.

  Parent start/end:   |-------------------...
  Child start/end:    |---------|
  Measurement data:   +++++++++++++++++++++++
  Added to child:     ***********

  CASE 7 - no child MP
  This is really an invalid state, but it can happen i production, so we include a test for it.
  Parent start/end:   |-------------------...
  Child start/end:    nothing
  Measurement data:    ++
  Added to child:     nothing

cases_tested:
  "Electrical Heating Tests":
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to electrical heating MP point for the day"
    - "WHEN (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"

  "Period length and base period limit":
    - "GIVEN (period length = 1 year) WHEN there is no end-of-period THEN base period limit = 4000"
    - "GIVEN (period length < 1 year) WHEN the period is a non-leap-year period THEN base period limit = (# period days/365 * 4000)"
    - "GIVEN (period length < 1 year) WHEN the period is a leap-year period THEN base period limit = (# period days/366 * 4000)"

  "Net Settlement Groups":
    - "Electrical heating without net settlement group"
