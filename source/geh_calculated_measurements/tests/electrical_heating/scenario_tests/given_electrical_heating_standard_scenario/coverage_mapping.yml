  ## PURPOSE
  Standard simple scenario demonstrating that energy is added to electrical heating MP when limit is not exceeded.
  Includes MP that crosses summer and wintertime transition.

cases_tested:
  "Electrical Heating Tests":
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to electrical heating MP point for the day"
    - "WHEN (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"

  "Period length and base period limit":
    - "GIVEN (period length = 1 year) WHEN there is no end-of-period THEN base period limit = 4000"

  "Summer/Wintertime handling":
    - "GIVEN it is the day of summer daylight savings change THEN we should only aggregate daily consumption for 23 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 21.45"
    - "GIVEN it is the day of winter daylight savings change THEN we should aggregate daily consumption for 25 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 22.45"

  "Net Settlement Groups":
    - "Electrical heating without net settlement group"
