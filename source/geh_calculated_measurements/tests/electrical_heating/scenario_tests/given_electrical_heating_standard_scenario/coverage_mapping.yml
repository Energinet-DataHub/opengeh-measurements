  ## PURPOSE
  Standard simple scenario demonstrating that energy is added to electrical heating MP when limit is not exceeded.
  Includes MP that crosses summer and wintertime transition.

cases_tested:
  "Electrical Heating Tests":
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
    - "WHEN (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to consumption metering point for the day"
    - "GIVEN period = 1 year WHEN there is no end-of-period THEN base period limit = 4000"

  "Summer/Wintertime handling":
    - "If it is the day of summer daylight savings change THEN we should only aggregate daily consumption for 23 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 21.45"
    - "If it is the day of winter daylight savings change THEN we should aggregate daily consumption for 25 hours AND last quarter of the day is UTC 22.45"

  "Net Settlement Groups":
    - "Electrical heating without net settlement group"
