  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test that we only generate a result for daily values which are different from existing daily values for electrical heating MP.

cases_tested:
  "Electrical Heating Tests":
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption =< period limit) THEN daily consumption in full should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"
    - "GIVEN (total period consumption < period limit) WHEN (daily consumption + total period consumption > period limit) THEN (period limit-total period consumption) should be added to electrical heating MP point for the day"
    - "WHEN (total period consumption => period limit) THEN 0 should be added to electrical heating MP for the day"
    - "GIVEN there is no active consumption MP OR there is no active electrical heating MP WHEN there is measurement data for the day THEN no energy is added to an electrical heating MP for the day"

  "Period length and base period limit":
    - "GIVEN (period length = 1 year) WHEN there is no end-of-period THEN base period limit = 4000"
    - "GIVEN (period length < 1 year) WHEN the period is a leap-year period THEN base period limit = (# period days/366 * 4000)"

  "Results Filtering":
    - "GIVEN the calculated result is the same for that MP/day AND the previous calculation type (up-to-end OR end-of-period) was the same as this THEN we should NOT generate a result for that MP/day"

  "Net Settlement Groups":
    - "Electrical heating without net settlement group"
