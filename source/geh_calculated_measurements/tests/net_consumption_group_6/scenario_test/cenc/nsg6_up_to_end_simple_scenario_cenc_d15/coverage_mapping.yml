  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test a simple scenario that involves a case where consumption_from_grid (D07) is bigger that supply_to_grid (D06) resulting in a positive value for net_consumption (D15)
  and a case where consumption_from_grid (D07) is smaller than supply_to_grid (D06) resulting in a negative value for net_consumption (D15), which will become 0 due to business rules.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

  CASE 1: (consumption_from_grid (D07) is bigger than supply_to_grid (D06))
  Settlement month is January 1st.
  Calculation period is from January 1st 2024 to December 31st 2024
  The period being estimated is from January 1st 2025 to the December 31st 2025
                        ______|2024________|2025________
  settlement month:     ------|+-----------|+-----------|
  calculation period:   ------|++++++++++++|------------|
  estimation period:    ------|------------|++++++++++++|

  consumption_from_grid (D07): 2000
  supply_to_grid (D06): 1000
  net_consumption (D15): 2000 - 1000 = 1000
  Daily quantity of 1000 / 365 = 2.7397 rounded to 2.740

  CASE 2: consumption_from_grid (D07) is smaller than supply_to_grid (D06)
  Settlement month is January 1st.
  Calculation period is from January 1st 2024 to December 31st 2024
  The period being estimated is from January 1st 2025 to the December 31st 2025
                        ______|2024________|2025________
  settlement month:     ------|+-----------|+-----------|
  calculation period:   ------|++++++++++++|------------|
  estimation period:    ------|------------|++++++++++++|

  consumption_from_grid (D07): 1000
  supply_to_grid (D06): 2000
  net_consumption (D15): 1000 - 2000 = -1000 (net_consumption (D15) can be negative so is changed to 0)
  this wil result in a daily quantity of 0 / 365 = 0

cases_tested:
  "cenc calculation":
    "GIVEN (consumption_from_grid (D07) is 2000 and supply_to_grid (D06) is 1000) WHEN (settlement month is the 1 of january) THEN (net_consumption (D15) is 1000 and daily quantity is 2.740)"
    "GIVEN (consumption_from_grid (D07) is 1000 and supply_to_grid (D06) is 2000) WHEN (settlement month is the 1 of january) THEN (net_consumption (D15) is 0 and daily quantity is 0)"
