  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test scenarios where there is a move in, in the middle of a period being used for estimation (cenc).

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

  CASE 1 (Move-in without electrical heating)
  smrd 1

                  |2023		                                     |2024		                                    |2025   |Today (Feb. 1st)
                  |----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------
  Parent period 1:|___________________________________________________________________________________|
  Parent period 2 (move-in):                                                                          |_______________...
  Periods:        |______________________________________________|____________________________________|________________...
  D06/D07 data (should be ignored for cenc due to move-in):            ++                                          +
  Not included in cenc:		      	   								   __                                          _
  Latest D15 existing measurement data:													                              +
  New D15 measurement data:																				               +

  A move in takes place in the middle of a period being used for estimation (cenc).
  This will result in a default quantity value of 1800 for the settlement periods and a daily quantity of 1800 / 365 = 4.9315 rounded to 4.932.

  CASE 2 (Move-in with electrical heating)
  smrd 6

                  |2023		            |smrd                    |2024		            |smrd                   |2025   |Today (Feb. 1st)

  Parent period 1:|___________________________________________________________________________________|
  Parent period 2 (move-in):                                                                          |_______________...
  Periods:        |_____________________|_______________________________________________|_____________|________________...
  D06/D07 data (should be ignored for cenc due to move-in):            ++                     +                   +
  Not included in cenc:		      	   								   __                     _                   _
  Latest D15 existing measurement data:													                              +
  New D15 measurement data:																				               +

  A move in takes place in the middle of a period being used for estimation (cenc).
  This will result in a default quantity value of 5600 for the settlement periods and a daily quantity of 5600 / 365 = 15.342.

cases_tested:
  "Smrd is 1"
  "Smrd is not 1"

  "cenc calculation":
    "D15 results should be generated up to latest either child D15 observation time, smrd date or parent period_to_date, whichever comes first"
    "GIVEN latest parent period is open WHEN this period is marked as move_in = true AND has_electrical_heating = false THEN default quantity value of 1800 for the settlement period and a daily quantity is 1800 / days in settlement year"
    "GIVEN latest parent period is open WHEN this period is marked as move_in = true AND has_electrical_heating = true THEN default quantity value of 5600 for the settlement period and a daily quantity is 5600 / days in settlement year"
