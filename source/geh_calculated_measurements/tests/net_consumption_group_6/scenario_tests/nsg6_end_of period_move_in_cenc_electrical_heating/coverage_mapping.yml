  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test scenarios where there is a move in, in the middle of a period being used for estimation (cenc)
  and the metering point also has electrical heating.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

  CASE 1
  settlement month is the 1 of january
  move in takes place in november 2024
  calculation period is from the 1 of january 2024 to the 31 of december 2024
  the period being estimated is from the 1 of january 2025 to the 31 of december 2025
                        ______|2024________|2025________
  settlement month:     ------|+-----------|+-----------|
  calculation period:   ------|++++++++++++|------------|
  estimation period:    ------|------------|++++++++++++|
  move in date:         ------|----------+-|------------|

  a move in takes place in the middle of a period being used for estimation (cenc)
  and the metering point also has electrical heating
  this will result in a default quantity value of 5600 for the settlement periods
  and a daily quantity of 5600 / 365 = 15.342

cases_tested:
  "Move in with electrical heating":
    - "GIVEN (settlement month is the 1 of january) WHEN (move in takes place in november 2024) THEN (default quantity value of 5600 for the settlement periods and a daily quantity of 5600 / 365 = 15.342)"
