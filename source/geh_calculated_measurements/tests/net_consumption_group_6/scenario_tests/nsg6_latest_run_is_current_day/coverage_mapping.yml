  ## PURPOSE
  The purpose is to test scenarios where the latest net_consumption is at the same day as the execution_start_datetime there should be no results.

  ## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

  CASE 1
  Calculation period is from the 1st of january 2024 to the 31 of december 2024.
  The period being estimated for is from the 1st of january 2025 to the 31 of december 2025.
                        ______|2024________|2025________
  settlement month:     ------|+-----------|+-----------|
  calculation period:   ------|++++++++++++|------------|
  estimation period:    ------|------------|++++++++++++|

  execution_start_datetime: 025-01-01T23:00:00Z

  latest net_consumption is 2025-01-01T23:00:00Z and is the same as the execution_start_datetime.
  This means that there will be no results.

cases_tested:
  "Latest net_consumption is at the same day as execution_start_datetime":
    - "GIVEN (calculation period is from 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31 and estimation period is from 2025-01-01 to 2025-12-31) WHEN (latest net_consumption is 2025-01-01T23:00:00Z, which is the same as execution_start_datetime) THEN (there will be no results)"
