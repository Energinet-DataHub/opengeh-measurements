"""
Child metering points related to electrical heating.

Periods are included when
- the metering point is of type
  'supply_to_grid' | 'consumption_from_grid' | 'net_consumption'
- the metering point is coupled to a parent metering point
  Note: The same child metering point cannot be re-coupled after being uncoupled
- the child metering point physical status is connected or disconnected.
- the period does not end before 2021-01-01

CSV formatting is according to ADR-144 with the following constraints:
- No column may use quoted values
- All date/time values must include seconds
