# Gold Layer

This python package handles streaming from the silver layer, to the gold layer.

## Gold Schema

See the [gold measurements](src/opengeh_gold/domain/schemas/gold_measurements.py) schema for more information, on the columns and data types used in the gold layer.

## Gold Transformations

The transformation from the Silver layer to the Gold layer consists of the following steps:
